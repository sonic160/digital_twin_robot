# Planning for today

1. Demonstration for data collection scheme
    - Show how the data are generated ([tutorial here](documents\cm_matlab_ros\how_to_use_condition_monitoring_app.md)).
    - Configurate the Matlab environment for data collection ([tutorial here](documents\cm_matlab_ros\build_msg_in_matlab.md))

2. Continue working on WP1
    - Deadline for submission: **28/04/2024**
    - How to submit:
        - Prepare a single notebook, named it as "WP1_Group_X.ipynb".
        - In the repository of the administrator:
            - Fetch the most up-to-date change from the original repository (sonic160/digital_twin_robot)
            - Create a new branch called "WP1_submission".
            - Create a new folder called "deliverables" in your workspace. For example, if you are group 1, then, you should have: `projects\maintenance_industry_4_2024\ws_group_1\deliverables`
            - Put your final notebook in this folder.
            - Create a pull request to merge your branch to "main" branch of the original repository (sonic160/digital_twin_robot)
            - Wait for the professor to merge the submission.

3. Start working on WP2, part 1: unsupervised learning
    - Apply statistical testing methods on the course project
    - Apply local outlier factor approach on the course project
