    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we interpret the statistical testing approach for fault detection. The basic idea of statistical testing approach is that we fit a multi-dimensitional distribution to the observation data under normal working condition. Then, when a new data point arrives, we design a hypothesis test to see whether the new data point is consistent with the distribution. If the new data point is consistent with the distribution, we can conclude that the fault is not due to the faulty component.\n",
