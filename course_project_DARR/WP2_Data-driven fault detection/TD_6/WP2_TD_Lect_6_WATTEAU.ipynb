    "\n",
    "- Task 1: Training data generation: Generate training data for your model, considering different working conditions of the robot.\n",
    "- Task 2: Model development.\n",
    "  - Data cleaning, preprocessing\n",
    "  - Investigate different possible model and train the final model\n",
    "- Task 3: GUI design and implementation.\n",
    "- Task 4: Data challenge: Each group will generate a separate dataset, which will be used to construct a final evaluation dataset for the other groups. The performance of your model will be evaluated through this testing dataset.\n",

    "1. Explore the data we collected last week, including:\n",
    "    - Data visualization to explore the patterns of the data\n",
    "    - Use Principle Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE to visualize the data, in order to have a first flavor about the difficulty of the problem \n",
    "    - Explore if we have a significant difference between different sequences through visualization and clustering\n",
    "2. Data cleaning and preprocessing\n",
    "    - Missing values and outlier handling\n",
    "    - Feature engineering\n",
    "3. Apply statistical testing approach.\n",
    "4. Apply a simple logistic regression model as a benchmark model for the classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, please:\n",
    "- Fetch the most up-to-date version of the github repository.\n",
