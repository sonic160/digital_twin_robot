    "\n",
    "This work package aims at developing a data-driven fault detection algorithm for the motors in the robot. The algorithm should be able to accurately detect faults under different working conditions of the robot, and to display the results in the GUI developed in WP1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Task 1: Training data generation: Generate training data for your model, considering different working conditions of the robot.\n",
    "- Task 2: Model development.\n",
    "  - Data cleaning, preprocessing\n",
    "  - Investigate different possible model and train the final model\n",
    "- Task 3: GUI design and implementation.\n",
    "- Task 4: Data challenge: Each group will generate a separate dataset, which will be used to construct a final evaluation dataset for the other groups. The performance of your model will be evaluated through this testing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Delierables\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Jupyter notebook reporting the model development process, including but not limited to:\n",

    "2. Data cleaning and preprocessing\n",
    "    - Missing values and outlier handling\n",
    "    - Feature engineering\n",
