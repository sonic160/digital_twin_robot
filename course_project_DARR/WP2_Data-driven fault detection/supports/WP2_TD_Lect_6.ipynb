    "\n",
    "- Task 1: Training data generation: Generate training data for your model, considering different working conditions of the robot.\n",
    "- Task 2: Model development.\n",
    "  - Data cleaning, preprocessing\n",
    "  - Investigate different possible model and train the final model\n",
    "- Task 3: GUI design and implementation.\n",
    "- Task 4: Data challenge: Each group will generate a separate dataset, which will be used to construct a final evaluation dataset for the other groups. The performance of your model will be evaluated through this testing dataset.\n",

    "    - Use Principle Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE to visualize the data, in order to have a first flavor about the difficulty of the problem \n",

    "2. Data cleaning and preprocessing\n",
    "    - Missing values and outlier handling\n",
